V3 to master published. 

Work to do 
- print speed
- if encounter, change movement speed

V2 to master published. 

V3: could do so that one monster increases speed until 3 coins, then more monsters appear
- if monster has a value of direction, those could be randomized? or every other lengthwise, every other heighwise? 
- if monster is encountered, reduce one coin and move to 0,0 (where no mosters can be created?) 
  - priority is to get this working! 

Did get monster encounter working for one monster and list multiple monsters. 
- continue by triyng to plot one monster per additional point and worry about moving them afterwards? 
- or by trying to for loop the movement pattern
- or by revising piirileikki / robots from sky 

A secret spot that enhances the speed to max 2?

V1 to master, V2 to some point. Many problems still with v2, including: 

- how to get point counter so that it only adds one BUT prints the text for example for 5 seconds
  - if only locations match, does the trick for points
- monster is not moving great 
- boundaries should be set
- time: change to systime minus start time and maybe a new robot every minute? 
- is there a way to start the game for example in 5 seconds / until you press enter: show instructions 

Fix some of these for V2! Point counting and coins appearing to a new place should be a priority so door and monsters appearing work!
