V1 to master, V2 to some point. Many problems still with v2, including: 

- how to get point counter so that it only adds one BUT prints the text for example for 5 seconds
  - if only locations match, does the trick for points
- monster is not moving great 
- boundaries should be set
- time: change to systime minus start time and maybe a new robot every minute? 
- is there a way to start the game for example in 5 seconds / until you press enter: show instructions 

Fix some of these for V2! Point counting and coins appearing to a new place should be a priority so door and monsters appearing work!
